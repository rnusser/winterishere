#### Installing multiple go versions

If you would like to install multiple go versions and be able to switch between them, the tool [gvm](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm) makes it quite easy.

```sh
gmv listall (list all possible go versions you can install)
gmv install go1.14
gvm list    (shows currently installed versions)
gvm use go1.14
```
